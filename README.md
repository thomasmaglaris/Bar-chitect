# Bar-chitect Cocktail Generator

## Description

Bar-chitect provides relevant cocktail recipe information using the Cocktaildb API. Users can search for cocktail recipes via two methods:

1. Search for cocktail recipe information via the cocktail name.
2. Search for cocktail recipe information via its ingredients.

Users will then be able to sign up/log in and save cocktail recipes so they can refer to them at a later date (W.I.P).
